## Got Compromised?

### Immediate Actions to take

> [!CAUTION]
> In the case of a npm supply chain compromise, here's what you can do immediately:
>
> **Identify compromised packages**
>
> Keep up to update from trusted newsfeed[^20][^21][^22][^23]. My personal choice is <https://socket.dev/blog>. Confirm with vulnerability databases like <https://security.snyk.io> or <https://socket.dev/search?e=npm>
>
> **Preserve evidence before cleanup**
>
> Before deleting caches or `node_modules`, preserve CI logs, package manager logs, lockfiles, `package.json`, npm token audit history, and a timestamped list of installed packages. This helps later root-cause analysis, credential-impact review, and any coordinated disclosure or insurance reporting.
>
> **Remove and replace compromised packages**
>
> ```sh
> # remove project cache
> rm -rf node_modules
> yarn cache clean
> pnpm cache delete
>
> # remove global cache
> npm cache clean --force
> yarn cache clean --mirror
> bun pm cache rm
> pnpm store prune
> ```
>
> Downgrade and pin dependencies to a known clean version, or remove them entirely.
>
> Remove `node_modules` folders from system: `cd ~ && npx npkill`, for example: `npx npkill --delete-all` or without `npkill`: `find . -name 'node_modules' -type d -prune -print -exec trash '{}' \;`
>
> **Restrict or disable automated scripts**
>
> Disable automated pipelines or restrict them while the investigation is ongoing.
>
> **Rotate all credentials**
>
> Supply chain attacks often targets credentials in the system. Revoke and regenerate `npm` tokens, GitHub PATs, SSH keys, and cloud provider credentials.
>
> **Monitoring suspicious activities**
>
> Review and monitor for unauthorized activities in your projects or organizations.
> Limit outbound network access to trusted domains only. Limit or revovke access from outsiders or third-party tools.
> Resume work on a brand new system (_highly recommended!_)

Pick the best practices below based on your needs to strengthen your system against the next attack.

## For Developers

> [!TIP]
> Highly recommend <https://npmx.dev> over npmjs.com, as it is a modern registry browser with features like [detailed package packages](https://npmx.dev/package/react), [compare](https://npmx.dev/compare), [source code and more](https://docs.npmx.dev/guide/features).

### 0. Helper Script

In this repository, there is a [sample `.npmrc` file](.npmrc) with safer configurations:

```txt
ignore-scripts=true
save-exact=true
provenance=true
```

And other configuration files examples are here:

- [`bunfig.toml`](bunfig.toml)
- [`pnpm-workspace.yaml`](pnpm-workspace.yaml)
- [`deno.json`](deno.json)
- [`.yarnrc.yml`](.yarnrc.yml)

But there's also a helper script [`default.sh`](default.sh) that setup few global defaults across package managers to make your system safer

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bodadotsh/npm-security-best-practices/refs/heads/main/default.sh | bash
```

> I'm aware of the irony a security best practice repo asks you to `curl | sh` a remote script 😅 this is for those who'll read
> the source code and want to have this process automated. The rest, this README acts as a reference to manually configure as you like.

Afterwards, you can run the following commands to check the package manager's global configs:

```sh
npm config list
pnpm config list
yarn config
cat ~/.bunfig.toml
```

### 1. Pin Dependency Versions

> [!TIP]
> It is debatable whether pinning versions is a best practice. There are sound basis on either side. Here, I am following the best practice suggested by the node.js security best practices[^28]. But feel free to [join the discussion](https://github.com/bodadotsh/npm-security-best-practices/issues/14) to see why you may not want to pin exact versions.

> On `npm`, by default, a new dependency will be installed with the Caret `^` operator. This operator installs the most recent `minor` or `patch` releases. E.g., `^1.2.3` will install `1.2.3`, `1.6.2`, etc. See <https://docs.npmjs.com/about-semantic-versioning> and try out the npm SemVer Calculator (<https://semver.npmjs.com>).

Here's how to pin exact version in various package managers:

```sh
npm install --save-exact react
pnpm add --save-exact react
yarn add --save-exact react
bun add --exact react
deno add npm:react@19.1.1
```

We can also update this setting in configuration files (e.g., [`.npmrc`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v11/configuring-npm/npmrc)), with either [`save-exact`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v11/using-npm/config#save-exact) or [`save-prefix`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v11/using-npm/config#save-prefix) key and value pairs:

```sh
npm config set save-exact=true
pnpm config set save-exact true
yarn config set defaultSemverRangePrefix ""
```

For `bun`, the config file is `bunfig.toml` and corresponding config is:

```toml
[install]
exact = true
```

#### Override the transitive dependencies

> **_However_**, our direct dependencies also have their own dependencies (_transitive_ dependencies). Even if we pin our direct dependencies, their transitive dependencies might still use broad version range operators (like `^` or `~`). The solution is to override the transitive dependencies: <https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v11/configuring-npm/package-json#overrides>

In `package.json`, if we have the following `overrides` field:

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "library-a": "^3.0.0"
  },
  "overrides": {
    "lodash": "4.17.21"
  }
}
```

- Let's assume that `⁠library-a`'s `⁠package.json` has a dependency on `"lodash": "^4.17.0"`
- Without the `⁠overrides` section, `⁠npm` might install `⁠lodash@4.17.22` (or any of the latest `⁠4.x.x` versions) as a transitive dependency of `⁠library-a`
- However, by adding `"overrides": { "lodash": "4.17.21" }`, we are telling `⁠npm` that anywhere `⁠lodash` appears in the dependency tree, it must be resolved to exactly version `⁠4.17.21`

For `pnpm`, we can also define the `overrides` field in the `pnpm-workspace.yaml` file: <https://pnpm.io/settings#overrides>

For `yarn`, the `resolutions` field is introduced before the `overrides` field, and it also offers a similar functionality: <https://yarnpkg.com/configuration/manifest#resolutions>

```json
{
  "resolutions": {
    "lodash": "4.17.21"
  }
}
```

```sh
# yarn also provide a cli to set the resolution: https://yarnpkg.com/cli/set/resolution
yarn set resolution <descriptor> <resolution>
```

For `bun`, it supports either the `overrides` field or the `resolutions` field: <https://bun.com/docs/install/overrides>

For `deno` and `deno.json`, see <https://docs.deno.com/runtime/fundamentals/modules/#overriding-dependencies>:

```json
{
  "links": [
    "../path/to/local_npm_package"
  ]
}
```

### 2. Include Lockfiles

> Ensure to commit package managers lockfiles to `git` and share between different environments[^26]. Different lockfiles are: `package-lock.json` for `npm`, `pnpm-lock.yaml` for `pnpm`, `bun.lock` for `bun`, `yarn.lock` for `yarn` and `deno.lock` for `deno`.
>
> In automated environments such as continuous integration and deployments, we should install the exact dependencies as defined in the lockfile.

```sh
npm ci
bun install --frozen-lockfile
yarn install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
deno install --frozen
```

For `deno`, we can also set the following in a `deno.json` file:

```json
{
  "lock": {
    "frozen": true
  }
}
```

> [!TIP]
>
> When dealing with merge conflicts in lockfiles, it is _not_ necessary to delete the lockfile. When dependencies (including transitive) are defined with version range operators (`^`, `~`, etc), re-building the lockfile from scratch can result in unexpected updates.
>
> Modern package managers have built-in conflict resolutions[^18][^19], just [checkout main and re-run `install`](https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn/issues/1776#issuecomment-269539948). `pnpm` also allows [Git Branch Lockfiles](https://pnpm.io/git_branch_lockfiles) where it creates a new lockfile based on branch name, and automatically merge it back into the main lockfile later.

### 3. Disable Lifecycle Scripts

> Lifecycle scripts are special scripts that happen in addition to the `pre<event>`, `post<event>`, and `<event>` scripts. For instance, `preinstall` is run before `install` is run and `postinstall` is run after `install` is run. See how npm handles the "scripts" field: <https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v11/using-npm/scripts#life-cycle-scripts>
>
> Lifecycle scripts are a common strategy from malicious actors. For example, the "Shai-Hulud" worms[^3] edit the `package.json` file to add a `postinstall` script that would then steal credentials.

```sh
npm config set ignore-scripts true --global
yarn config set enableScripts false
```

For `bun`, `deno` and `pnpm`, they are disabled by default.

> [!NOTE]
>
> For `bun`, the [top 500 npm packages](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/blob/main/src/install/default-trusted-dependencies.txt) with lifecycle scripts are allowed by default.

> [!TIP]
> We can combine many of the flags above. For example, the following `npm` command would install only production dependencies as defined in the lockfile and ignore lifecycle scripts:
>
> `npm ci --omit=dev --ignore-scripts`

### 4. Preinstall Preventions

> How do we know and trust that whenever we do `npm install <package-name>`, everything will be fine? We shouldn't. Here's how we can ensure that the `install` command is safer to run:

#### Preinstall Scanners

Socket Firewall Free <https://socket.dev/blog/introducing-socket-firewall>

```sh
npm i -g sfw
# works for `npm`, `yarn`, `pnpm`
sfw npm install <package-name>

# example: alias `npm` to `sfw npm` in zsh
# echo "alias npm='sfw npm'" >> ~/.zshrc
```

brin (from superagent.sh) <https://github.com/superagent-ai/brin>

Safe packge installations especially for the agents era

```sh
npm install -g brin
```

Aikido Safe Chain <https://github.com/AikidoSec/safe-chain>

The Aikido Safe Chain wraps around the npm cli, `npx`, `yarn`, `pnpm`, `pnpx`, `bun`, `bunx`, and `pip` to provide extra checks before installing new packages

```sh
npm install -g @aikidosec/safe-chain
```

<https://github.com/lirantal/npq>

```sh
npq install express
NPQ_PKG_MGR=pnpm npx npq install fastify
```

With Bun, we can use its [Security Scanner API](https://bun.com/docs/pm/security-scanner-api)

```sh
bun add -d @socketsecurity/bun-security-scanner
```

From Bun v1.3+, you can [integrate Socket with Bun](https://socket.dev/blog/socket-integrates-with-bun-1-3-security-scanner-api)

```toml
# in bunfig.toml
[install.security]
scanner = "@socketsecurity/bun-security-scanner"
```

#### Set Minimal Release Age

> We can set a delay to avoid installing newly published packages. This applies to all dependencies, including transitive ones. For example, `pnpm v10.16` introduced the `minimumReleaseAge` option: <https://pnpm.io/settings#minimumreleaseage>, which defines the minimum number of minutes that must pass after a version is published before pnpm will install it. If `minimumReleaseAge` is set to `1440`, then pnpm will not install a version that was published less than 24 hours ago.

```sh
# since npm v11.10.0
npm config set min-release-age=7 --global

bun add <package> --minimum-release-age <seconds>

pnpm config set minimumReleaseAge <minutes> --global

yarn config set -H npmMinimalAgeGate '7d'

deno install --minimum-dependency-age=P7D
```

> [!TIP]
> Want to quickly set these as defaults globally? Check the [helper script](#0-helper-script).

Examples of other tools that offer similar functionalities:

- `npm-check-updates` (<https://github.com/raineorshine/npm-check-updates>) has the `--cooldown/-c` flag, for example: `npx npm-check-updates -i --format group -c 7`
- Renovate CLI (<https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate>) has a [`minimumReleaseAge`](https://docs.renovatebot.com/configuration-options/#minimumreleaseage) config option.
- Step Security (<https://www.stepsecurity.io>) has a [NPM Package Cooldown Check](https://www.stepsecurity.io/blog/introducing-the-npm-package-cooldown-check) feature.

### 5. Runtime Protections

Most techniques focus on the _install_ and _build_ phases, we can add an extra layer of security during the _runtime_ phase of JavaScript applications.

#### Permission Model

> In the latest LTS version of `nodejs`, we can use the Permission model to control what system resources a process has access to or what actions the process can take with those resources. **_However_**, this does not provide security guarantees in the presence of malicious code. Malicious code can still bypass the permission model and execute arbitrary code without the restrictions imposed by the permission model.

Read about the Node.js permission model: <https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/permissions.html>

```sh
# by default, granted full access
node index.js

# restrict access to all available permissions
node --permission index.js

# enable specific permissions
node --permission --allow-fs-read=* --allow-fs-write=* index.js

# use permission model with `npx`
npx --node-options="--permission" <package-name>
```

Deno disables permissions by default. See <https://docs.deno.com/runtime/fundamentals/security/>

```sh
# by default, restrict access
deno run script.ts

# enable specific permission
deno run --allow-read script.ts
```

For Bun, the permission model is currently discussed [here](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/discussions/725) and [here](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/issues/6617).

#### Hardened JavaScript

Companies like MetaMask and Moddable uses <https://www.npmjs.com/package/ses> and <https://github.com/LavaMoat/LavaMoat> to enable runtime protections like prevent modifying JavaScript's primordials (Object, String, Number, Array, ...), and limit access to the platform API (window, document, XHR, etc) per-package. These mechanism are also suggested as TC39 proposals like <https://github.com/tc39/proposal-compartments>

> Watch [The Attacker is Inside: Javascript Supplychain Security and LavaMoat (~20mins, Nov 2022)](https://youtu.be/Z5Bz0DYga1k) to get a quick high level overview of how this works.

### 6. Reduce External Dependencies

> Because `npm` has a low barrier for publishing packages, the ecosystem quickly grew to be the biggest package registry with over 5 million packages to date[^11]. But not all packages are created equal. There are small utility packages[^8] that are downloaded as dependencies when we could write them ourselves and raise the question of "have we forgotten how to code?[^12]"

Between `nodejs`, `bun`, `deno` and the Web APIs, developers can use many of their modern features instead of relying on third-party libraries. The native modules may not provide the same level of functionality, but they should be considered whenever possible. Here are few examples:

| NPM libraries                     | Built-in modules                                                   |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `axios`, `node-fetch`, `got`, etc | native`fetch` API                                                  |
| `jest`, `mocha`, `ava`, etc       | `node:test`,`node:assert`, `bun test` and `deno test`              |
| `nodemon`, `chokidar`, etc        | `node --watch`, `bun --watch` and `deno --watch`                   |
| `dotenv`, `dotenv-expand`, etc    | `node --env-file`, `bun --env-file` and `deno --env-file`          |
| `typescript`, `ts-node`, etc      | `node --experimental-strip-types`[^10], native to `deno` and `bun` |
| `esbuild`, `rollup`, etc          | `bun build` and `deno bundle`                                      |
| `prettier`, `eslint`, etc         | `deno lint` and `deno fmt`                                         |

### 7. Isolated development

Developing code in an isolated environment is a popular and effective way of preventing supply-chain attacks. Some wellknown local virtual machines (VMs) solutions are: [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/), [VMware Fusion](https://www.vmware.com/products/desktop-hypervisor/workstation-and-fusion), [Parallels Desktop](https://www.parallels.com/), and [OrbStack](https://orbstack.dev/).

> Example of [Mitchell Hashimoto](https://github.com/mitchellh) running NixOS through VMware Fusion on macOS: <https://youtu.be/ubDMLoWz76U>

Cloud sandbox also offer an easier setup path and can be used directly within browsers, popular products are: [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io), [Ona (prev Gitpod)](https://ona.com/), [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces), and many more.

Container-based development are also gaining adoptions, especially with the [Development Containers](https://containers.dev/) specification that is focused on enriching containers with development specific content and settings.

## For Maintainers

### 8. Enable 2FA

<https://docs.npmjs.com/about-two-factor-authentication>

> Two factor authentication (2FA) adds an extra layer of authentication to your `npm` account. 2FA is not required by default, but from December 2025, when you create a new package, 2FA will be enabled by default in the package settings.

```sh
# ensure that 2FA is enabled for auth and writes (this is the default)
npm profile enable-2fa auth-and-writes
```

| Automation level | Package publishing access                                                                                                                     |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Manual           | Set each package access to `Require 2FA` and `Disable Tokens`                                                                                 |
| Automatic        | Set each package access to `Require two-factor authentication` OR `Single factor automation tokens` OR `Single factor granular access tokens` |

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> It is advised to configure a security-key that support [WebAuthn](https://caniuse.com/?search=webauthn), instead of time-based one-time password (TOTP)[^17]

### 9. Create Tokens with Limited Access

> [!TIP]
>
> Best practice: prefer _trusted publishing_ over tokens if possible! See [the "trusted publishing" section below](#trusted-publishing) for more details.

<https://docs.npmjs.com/about-access-tokens#about-granular-access-tokens>

> At the end of 2025, NPM announced the [sunset of Legacy Tokens](https://github.blog/changelog/2025-09-29-strengthening-npm-security-important-changes-to-authentication-and-token-management/) to improve security. [Granular Access Tokens](https://docs.npmjs.com/about-access-tokens#about-granular-access-tokens) is the default going forward[^27].

Create granular access tokens via the website: <https://docs.npmjs.com/creating-and-viewing-access-tokens#creating-granular-access-tokens-on-the-website> or `npm` cli: <https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v11/commands/npm-token>

The `npm login` cli command enables a two-hour session token instead of long-lived tokens. During these sessions, 2FA is enforced for publishing operations, adding an extra layer of security.

Here are some best practices when creating tokens:

- Descriptive token names
- Restrict token to specific packages, scopes, and organizations
- Set a token expiration date (e.g., annually)
- Limit token access based on IP address ranges (CIDR notation)
- Select between read-only or read and write access
- Don't use the same token for multiple purposes

### 10. Generate Provenance Statements

<https://docs.npmjs.com/generating-provenance-statements>

> The _provenance attestation_ is established by publicly providing a link to a package's source code and build instructions from the build environment. This allows developers to verify where and how your package was built before they download it.
>
> The _publish attestations_ are generated by the registry when a package is published by an authorized user. When an npm package is published with provenance, it is signed by Sigstore public good servers and logged in a public transparency ledger, where users can view this information.
>
> For example, here's what a provenance statement look like on the `vue` package page: <https://www.npmjs.com/package/vue#provenance>

To establish provenance, use a supported CI/CD provider (e.g., GitHub Actions) and publish with the correct flag:

```sh
npm publish --provenance
```

To publish without evoking the `npm publish` command, we can do one of the following:

- Set `NPM_CONFIG_PROVENANCE` to `true` in CI/CD environment
- Add `provenance=true` to `.npmrc` file
- Add `publishConfig` block to `package.json`

```json
"publishConfig": {
  "provenance": true
}
```

> For those interested in [Reproducible Builds](https://reproducible-builds.org), check out OSS Rebuild (<https://github.com/google/oss-rebuild>) and the Supply-chain Levels for Software Artifacts (SLSA) framework (<https://slsa.dev>).

#### Trusted Publishing

> Use _trusted publishing_ over tokens whenever possible[^17]

When using OpenID Connect (OIDC) auth, one can publish packages _without_ npm tokens, and get _automatic_ provenance. This is called **trusted publishing** and read the GitHub announcement here: <https://github.blog/changelog/2025-07-31-npm-trusted-publishing-with-oidc-is-generally-available/>

See <https://docs.npmjs.com/trusted-publishers> for instructions on how to configure trusted publishing.

Related tools:

- <https://github.com/antfu/open-packages-on-npm> (CLI to setup Trusted Publisher for monorepo packages)
- <https://github.com/sxzz/userscripts/blob/main/src/npm-trusted-publisher.md> (Userscript to fill the form for Trusted Publisher on npmjs.com)

### 11. Review Published Files

> Limiting the files in an npm package helps prevent malware by reducing the attack surface, and it avoids accidental leaking of sensitive data

The `files` field in `package.json` is used to specify the files that should be included in the published package. Certain files are always included, see: <https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v11/configuring-npm/package-json#files> for more details.

```json
{
  "name": "my-package",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "main": "dist/index.js",
  "files": ["dist", "LICENSE", "README.md"]
}
```

> [!TIP]
>
> The `.npmignore` file can also be used to exclude files from the published package. It will not override the `"files"` field, but in subdirectories it will.
>
> The `.npmignore` file works just like a `.gitignore`. If there is a `.gitignore` file, and `.npmignore` is missing, `.gitignore`'s contents will be used instead.

Run `npm pack --dry-run` or `npm publish --dry-run` to see what would happen when we run the pack or publish command.

```sh
> npm pack --dry-run
npm notice Tarball Contents
npm notice 1.1kB LICENSE
npm notice 1.9kB README.md
npm notice 108B index.js
npm notice 700B package.json
npm notice Tarball Details
```

In `deno.json`, use the `publish.include` and `publish.exclude` fields to specify the files that should be included or excluded:

```json
{
  "publish": {
    "include": ["dist/", "README.md", "deno.json"],
    "exclude": ["**/*.test.*"]
  }
}
```

## Miscellaneous

### 12. NPM Organization

<https://docs.npmjs.com/organizations>

At the organization level, best practices are:

- Enable `Require 2FA` at the Organization Level
- Minimise the number of `npm` Organization members
- If multiple package teams in same organization, set the `developers` Team permission for all packages to `READ`
- Create separate Teams to manage permissions for each package

### 13. Alternative Registry

JSR is a modern JavaScript/TypeScript package registry with backwards compatibility with npm.

> [!NOTE]
> Not all npm packages are on JSR!
>
> Visit <https://jsr.io> to see if the package is available and read the [npm limitations](https://jsr.io/docs/npm-compatibility#limitations) documentation.

```sh
deno add jsr:<package-name>
pnpm add jsr:<package-name> # pnpm 10.9+
yarn add jsr:<package-name> # yarn 4.9+
# npm, bun, and older versions of yarn or pnpm
npx jsr add <package-name> # replace npx with yarn dlx, pnpm dlx, or bunx
```

#### Private Registry

> Private package registries are a great way for organizations to manage their own dependencies, acts as a proxy to the public `npm` registry, and enforce security policies before they are used in a project.

Here are some private registries that you might find useful:

- GitHub Packages <https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-npm-registry>

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Currently, GitHub Packages only supports personal access token (classic), but classic PATs can be insecure as it has broad permissions and lacks of granular permissions![^24][^25]
> For this reason, you may want to pick an alternative package registry from below ⬇️

- Verdaccio <https://github.com/verdaccio/verdaccio>
  - See Verdaccio best practices: <https://verdaccio.org/docs/best/>
- Vlt <https://www.vlt.sh/>
  - [vlt’s Serverless Registry](https://docs.vlt.sh/registry) (VSR) can be deployed to Cloudflare Workers in minutes.
- JFrog Artifactory <https://jfrog.com/integrations/npm-registry>
- Sonatype: <https://help.sonatype.com/en/npm-registry.html>
- Cloudsmith: <https://cloudsmith.com/>

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Private registries have the advantages of separating the supply chain from the public registry, and enforce custom security policies. But they also have the disadvantages of being more complex to setup and maintain, and can be more expensive (cost of storage and bandwidth) to use.

> [!TIP]
> **No Registry?** If the usage of a public registry like `npm` is a real concern, it is also possible to build and import the library yourself as long as you have access to the source code. See <https://boda.sh/blog/pnpm-workspace-git-submodules/> for adding packages without `npm` but with `pnpm workspace` and `git submodules`.

### 14. Audit, Monitor and Security Tools

#### Audit

> Many package managers provide audit functionality to scan your project's dependencies for known security vulnerabilities, show a report and recommend the best way to fix them.

```sh
npm audit # audit dependencies
npm audit fix # automatically install any compatible updates
npm audit signatures # verify the signatures of the dependencies

pnpm audit
pnpm audit --fix

bun audit

deno audit
deno audit --socket

yarn npm audit
yarn npm audit --recursive # audit transitive dependencies
```

> [!TIP]
> There is a `npm sbom` command (<https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v11/commands/npm-sbom>) that output SBOM which is often required for security auditing. See related [`pnpm` SBOM discussion](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/9088).

#### GitHub

> <https://github.com/security>

GitHub offers several services that can help protect against `npm` malwares, including:

- [Dependabot](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/getting-started/dependabot-quickstart-guide): This tool automatically scans your project's dependencies, including `npm` packages, for known vulnerabilities.
- [Software Bill of Materials (SBOMs)](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/supply-chain-security/understanding-your-software-supply-chain/exporting-a-software-bill-of-materials-for-your-repository): GitHub allows you to export an SBOM for your repository directly from its dependency graph. An SBOM provides a comprehensive list of all your project's dependencies, including transitive ones (dependencies of your dependencies).
- [Code Scanning](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/introduction-to-code-scanning/about-code-scanning): Code scanning can also help identify potential vulnerabilities or suspicious patterns that might arise from integrating compromised `npm` packages.

> [!WARNING]
> If you spot vulnerabilities or issues in NPM or Github, please report them using the following links:
>
> - <https://docs.npmjs.com/reporting-malware-in-an-npm-package>
> - <https://docs.github.com/en/communities/maintaining-your-safety-on-github/reporting-abuse-or-spam#reporting-a-repository>

#### OpenSSF Scorecard

> <https://securityscorecards.dev> and <https://github.com/ossf/scorecard>

Free and open source automated tool that assesses a number of important heuristics ("checks") associated with software security and assigns each check a score of 0-10. Several risks mentioned in this repository are included as part of the checks: Pinned Dependencies, Token Permissions, Packaging, Signed Releases,...

Run the checks:

1. automatically on code you own using the [GitHub Action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/ossf-scorecard-action)
2. manually on your (or somebody else’s) project via the [Command Line](https://github.com/ossf/scorecard#scorecard-command-line-interface)

#### Socket.dev

> <https://socket.dev>

Socket.dev is a security platform that protects code from both vulnerable and malicious dependencies. It offers various tools such as a [GitHub App](https://socket.dev/features/github) scans pull requests, [CLI tool](https://socket.dev/features/cli), [web extension](https://socket.dev/features/web-extension), [VSCode extension](https://docs.socket.dev/docs/socket-for-vs-code) and more. Here's their talk on [AI powered malware hunting at scale, Jan 2025](https://youtu.be/cxJPiMwoIyY). Plus the Socket Firewall `sfw` tool in the [Preinstall Scanners section](https://github.com/bodadotsh/npm-security-best-practices/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#preinstall-scanners).

#### Snyk

> <https://snyk.io>

Snyk offers a suite of tools to fix vulnerabilities in open source dependencies, including a CLI to run vulnerability scans on local machine, IDE integrations to embed into development environment, and API to integrate with Snyk programmatically. For example, you can [test public npm packages before use](https://docs.snyk.io/developer-tools/snyk-cli/scan-and-maintain-projects-using-the-cli/test-public-npm-packages-before-use) or [create automatic PRs for known vulnerabilities](https://docs.snyk.io/scan-with-snyk/pull-requests/snyk-pull-or-merge-requests/create-automatic-prs-for-backlog-issues-and-known-vulnerabilities-backlog-prs).

#### FOSSA

> <https://fossa.com/>

FOSSA is a compliance and security platform that helps organizations manage the complexities of their software supply chain. It achieves this by providing visibility into all software components, from [packages and containers to binaries](https://fossa.com/products/scan/). By generating comprehensive SBOMs (Software Bill of Materials), companies reduce legal and IP risk, consolidate vulnerability management across their codebase, and [comply with regulatory reporting requirements](https://fossa.com/solutions/due-diligence/).

### 15. Support OSS

> Maintainer burnout is a significant problem in the open-source community. Many popular `npm` packages are maintained by volunteers who work in their spare time, often without any compensation. Over time, this can lead to exhaustion and a lack of motivation, making them more susceptible to social engineering where a malicious actor pretends to be a helpful contributor and eventually injects malicious code.

> In 2018, the `event-stream` package was compromised due to the maintainer giving access to a malicious actor[^13]. Another example outside the JavaScript ecosystem is the XZ Utils incident[^14] in 2024 where a malicious actor worked for over three years to attain a position of trust.

> OSS donations also help create a more sustainable model for open-source development. Foundations can help support the business, marketing, legal, technical assistance and direct support behind hundreds of open source projects that so many rely upon[^15][^16].

In the JavaScript ecosystem, the OpenJS Foundation (<https://openjsf.org>) was founded in 2019 from a merger of JS Foundation and Node.js Foundation to support some of the most important JS projects. And few other platforms are listed below where you can donate and support the OSS you use everyday:

- GitHub Sponsors <https://github.com/sponsors>
- Open Collective <https://opencollective.com>
- Thanks.dev <https://thanks.dev>
- Open Source Pledge <https://opensourcepledge.com>
- Ecosystem Funds: <https://funds.ecosyste.ms>
